COALESCE
============

The COALESCE function accepts an unlimited number of arguements. It returns the first arguement that is not null. If all arguements are null, the COALESCE function will return null.
- COALESCE (arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_n)
EXAMPLE L:
  - SELECT COALESCE (1,2)
    - 1
  - SELECT COALESCE (NULL, 2, 3) 
    - 2 
With the first value in the second being NULL THE COALESCE function skips over it and starts at the first non null option which is 2.

The COALESCE function becomes useful when querying a table that contains null values and substituting it with another value.
Simple example:
- Table of products
- Price and discount in dollars:

item | price | discount
-----------------------
 A   |  100  |   20
 B   |  300  |   null
 C   |  200  |   10

COALESCE simply replaces null values in this mathematical instances with just a 0, without altering your original table.
If we use:
SELECT item, (price - discount) AS final FROM table;

item | final  |
---------------
 A   |  80    |   
 B   |  null  |   
 C   |  190   |   
This will be our result.

Instead we will use:
SELECT item,(price - COALESCE(discount,0))AS final FROM table;

item | final  |
---------------
 A   |  80    |   
 B   |  300   |   
 C   |  190   |  

Keep the COALESCE function in mind in case you encounter a table with null values that you want to perform operations on.
