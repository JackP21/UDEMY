VIEWS
===========

Often there are specific combinations of tables and conditions that you find yourself using quite often for a project.
Instead of having to perform the same query over an over again as a starting point, you can create a VIEW to quickly see this query with a simple call.

If you find yourself always joining the same two tables then you can create whats called a VIEW.
