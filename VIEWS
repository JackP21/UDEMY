VIEWS
===========

Often there are specific combinations of tables and conditions that you find yourself using quite often for a project.
Instead of having to perform the same query over an over again as a starting point, you can create a VIEW to quickly see this query with a simple call.

If you find yourself always joining the same two tables then you can create whats called a VIEW.

A view is a database object that is of a stored query.
A view can be accessed as a virtual table in PostgreSQL.
Notice that view does not store dataphysically, it simply stores the query.
You can also update and alter any existing views.

To create a VIEW:
CREATE VIEW customer_info AS 
SELECT first_name, last_name, address 
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id = address.address_id;

Then you will be able to access this view by:
SELECT * FROM customer_info;

If you need to alter or update anything in the query:
CREATE OR REPLACE customer_info AS 
SELECT first_name, last_name, address, district
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address
ON customer.address_id = address.address_id;

To rename the query:
ALTER VIEW customer_info RENAME TO c_info;

Finally to delete  the VIEW:
DROP VIEW c_info;
