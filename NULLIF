NULLIF
=========

The NULLIF function takes in 2 inputs and returns NULL if both are equal, otherwise it returns the first arguement passed. 
- NULLIF(arg1,arg2)
Example: 
NULLIF(10,10)
This returns NULL, this is because they are equal to each other.

If you had:
NULLIF(10,12)
This would return 10.

This becomes very useful in cases where a NULL value would cause an error or unwanted result.
Example:
Given this table, calculate the ratio of department A to department B.

Name    | Department
--------+-----------
Lauren  |    A
Vinton  |    A
Claire  |    B

We can easily see the ratio of A to B is 2:1 or 200%. Using SQL to solve this using a CASE statement.
To find the ratio:
SELECT (
SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'B' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
) AS department_ratio
FROM depts
This would return to us 2.

If we deleted people from department B and ran the same query, we would be returned a error message saying we cannot divide by zero.
To use NULLIF to stop this error we would write:
SELECT (
SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/
NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN department = 'B' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),0)
)AS department_ratio
FROM depts
