LIKE and ILIKE
====================

The LIKE operator allows us to perform pattern matching against string data with the use of wildcard characters. 
These are:
- Percent - % 
  - This matches any sequence of characters.
- Underscore - _
  - This matches any single characters.

Using Percent:
- All names that begin with the letter 'A', the syntax would be:
  - WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
This would bring up all names that have the starting letter A.
- All names that end with the letter 'a', would be:
  - WHERE name LIKE '%a';
This will bring up all the names that end with the letter 'a'.
You can also have it like:
- WHERE name LIKE '%her%';
This would return all names that include the letters 'her' anywhere in them.

LIKE and ILIKE work the same way but with LIKE you need to be careful on the capitalisation of the words you use where as ILIKE is case insensitive where you don't need to use capitals.

Using Underscore:
The underscore allows us to replace a single character in a word, for example:
If I wanted all mission impossible films I would put
- WHERE title LIKE 'Mission Impossible _';
And this would give me mission impossible 1,2,3,4,etc.
You can use mulitple underscores:
A version of string codes in the format 'versionA4', 'versionB7', etc.
- WHERE value LIKE 'version _ _';

We can also combine pattern matching operators to create more complex patterns:
- WHERE name LIKE '_her%';
Names can include: 
- Cheryl
- Theresa
- Sherri
