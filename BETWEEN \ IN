BETWEEN / IN  
=================

BETWEEN
The BETWEEN operator can be used to match a value against a range of values.

The BETWEEN operator is the same as putting:
  value >= low AND <= high;
  value BETWEEN low AND high;
We can also combine BETWEEN with the NOT logical operator.
  value NOT BETWEEN low AND high;
The NOT BETWEEN operator is the same as:
  value < low or value > high
  value NOT BETWEEN low AND high;

The BETWEEN operator can also be used with dates. Note that dates are published in ISO 8601 standard format YYY-MM-DD
  date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-02-01';
When using BETWEEN with dates thta also include timestamp information, pay attention using BETWEEN versus <=, >= comparison operators due to the fact that a date starts with 00:00.

IN 

In certain cases you want to check for multiple possible value options, for example, if a users name shows up in a list of known names. We can use IN to create a condition that checks to see if a value included in a list of mulitple options.
The general syntax for that would be:
value IN(option1, option2,...,option n)

SELECT colour FROM table 
WHERE colour (NOT) IN ('red','blue', 'green');
NOT IN can be put in place to say that it is not there.
