Timestamps and EXTRACT
------------------------------

There are a few commands that report back time and date information, these will be more useful when creating our own tables and databases, rather than using them for qurying a database.

In PostGreSQL we see that the database can hold date and time information.
some syntax would be:
- TIME - Contains only time.
- DATE - contains only date.
- TIMESTAMP - Contains both time and date.
- TIMESTAMPTZ - Contains both time and date and also a timezone.
